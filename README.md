# CEjQT
Here I test stuff with OpenGL and QT and other stuff. I have only tested this on my machine on Visual Studio Community 2015 Release x86/windows 10.

# Embedding Python / Anaconda
I am also working on embedding a python interpreter.
For the python stuff I currently use Anaconda3-4.2.0-Windows-x86.exe installed on the C: drive.

#QT5
For Qt I use QT 5.7.

I install it on C:\QT\5.7\msvc2015

#OpenGL
For now I use the OpenGL widget that comes with QT5!
